# Power Apparatus and System Design 
## Assignment 1

First row contains information about base values sequentialy:
No. of Buses(Nb), No. of Branches(Nb-1), maximum error allowed(epsilon take 10^-4 for first problem), Maximum no of iterations(take 10 for first problem),Vbase(kv), Sbase(MV)

---

Consecutive rows containg information about grid sequentialy:
Branch No. , Sending End Node, Recieving End Node, Branch Resistance(Ohm), Branch Reactance(Ohm), Active Power(kW), Reactive Power(kVar)
